class CausalForestDML(_BaseDML):
    """A Causal Forest [1]_ combined with double machine learning based residualization of the treatment
    and outcome variables. It fits a forest that solves the local moment equation problem:

    .. code-block::

        E[ (Y - E[Y|X, W] - <theta(x), T - E[T|X, W]> - beta(x)) (T;1) | X=x] = 0

    where E[Y|X, W] and E[T|X, W] are fitted in a first stage in a cross-fitting manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_y: estimator or 'auto', optional (default is 'auto')
        The estimator for fitting the response to the features. Must implement
        `fit` and `predict` methods.
        If 'auto' :class:`.WeightedLassoCV`/:class:`.WeightedMultiTaskLassoCV` will be chosen.

    model_t: estimator or 'auto', optional (default is 'auto')
        The estimator for fitting the treatment to the features.
        If estimator, it must implement `fit` and `predict` methods;
        If 'auto', :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` will be applied for discrete treatment,
        and :class:`.WeightedLassoCV`/:class:`.WeightedMultiTaskLassoCV`
        will be applied for continuous treatment.

    featurizer : :term:`transformer`, optional, default None
        Must support fit_transform and transform. Used to create composite features in the final CATE regression.
        It is ignored if X is None. The final CATE will be trained on the outcome of featurizer.fit_transform(X).
        If featurizer=None, then CATE is trained on X.

    discrete_treatment: bool, optional (default is ``False``)
        Whether the treatment values should be treated as categorical, rather than continuous, quantities

    categories: 'auto' or list, default 'auto'
        The categories to use when encoding discrete treatments (or 'auto' to use the unique sorted values).
        The first category will be treated as the control treatment.

    n_crossfit_splits: int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional (Default=2)
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - :term:`CV splitter`
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the treatment is discrete
        :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold` is used, else,
        :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.KFold` is used
        (with a random shuffle in either case).

        Unless an iterable is used, we call `split(X,T)` to generate the splits.

    n_estimators : int, default=100
        Number of trees

    criterion : {``"mse"``, ``"het"``}, default="mse"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are ``"mse"`` for the mean squared error in a linear moment estimation tree and ``"het"`` for
        heterogeneity score.

        - The ``"mse"`` criterion finds splits that minimize the score

          .. code-block::

            sum_{child} E[(Y - <theta(child), T> - beta(child))^2 | X=child] weight(child)

          Internally, for the case of more than two treatments or for the case of one treatment with
          ``fit_intercept=True`` then this criterion is approximated by computationally simpler variants for
          computationaly purposes. In particular, it is replaced by:

          .. code-block::

            sum_{child} weight(child) * rho(child).T @ E[(T;1) @ (T;1).T | X in child] @ rho(child)

          where:

          .. code-block::

                rho(child) := E[(T;1) @ (T;1).T | X in parent]^{-1}
                                * E[(Y - <theta(x), T> - beta(x)) (T;1) | X in child]

          This can be thought as a heterogeneity inducing score, but putting more weight on scores
          with a large minimum eigenvalue of the child jacobian ``E[(T;1) @ (T;1).T | X in child]``,
          which leads to smaller variance of the estimate and stronger identification of the parameters.

        - The "het" criterion finds splits that maximize the pure parameter heterogeneity score

          .. code-block::

            sum_{child} weight(child) * rho(child)[:n_T].T @ rho(child)[:n_T]

          This can be thought as an approximation to the ideal heterogeneity score:

          .. code-block::

            weight(left) * weight(right) || theta(left) - theta(right)||_2^2 / weight(parent)^2

          as outlined in [1]_

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=10
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=5
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    min_var_fraction_leaf : None or float in (0, 1], default=None
        A constraint on some proxy of the variation of the treatment vector that should be contained within each
        leaf as a percentage of the total variance of the treatment vector on the whole sample. This avoids
        performing splits where either the variance of the treatment is small and hence the local parameter
        is not well identified and has high variance. The proxy of variance is different for different criterion,
        primarily for computational efficiency reasons. If ``criterion='het'``, then this constraint translates to::

            for all i in {1, ..., T.shape[1]}:
                Var(T[i] | X in leaf) > `min_var_fraction_leaf` * Var(T[i])

        If ``criterion='mse'``, because the criterion stores more information about the leaf for
        every candidate split, then this constraint imposes further constraints on the pairwise correlations
        of different coordinates of each treatment, i.e.::

            for all i neq j:
                sqrt( Var(T[i]|X in leaf) * Var(T[j]|X in leaf)
                    * ( 1 - rho(T[i], T[j]| in leaf)^2 ) )
                    > `min_var_fraction_leaf` sqrt( Var(T[i]) * Var(T[j]) * (1 - rho(T[i], T[j])^2 ) )

        where rho(X, Y) is the Pearson correlation coefficient of two random variables X, Y. Thus this
        constraint also enforces that no two pairs of treatments be very co-linear within a leaf. This
        extra constraint primarily has bite in the case of more than two input treatments and also avoids
        leafs where the parameter estimate has large variance due to local co-linearities of the treatments.

    min_var_leaf_on_val : bool, default=False
        Whether the `min_var_fraction_leaf` constraint should also be enforced to hold on the validation set of the
        honest split too. If ``min_var_leaf=None`` then this flag does nothing. Setting this to True should
        be done with caution, as this partially violates the honesty structure, since the treatment variable
        of the validation set is used to inform the split structure of the tree. However, this is a benign
        dependence as it only uses local correlation structure of the treatment T to decide whether
        a split is feasible.

    max_features : int, float or {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and `int(max_features * n_features)` features
          are considered at each split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.
        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    max_samples : int or float in (0, 1], default=.45,
        The number of samples to use for each subsample that is used to train each tree:

        - If int, then train each tree on `max_samples` samples, sampled without replacement from all the samples
        - If float, then train each tree on `ceil(`max_samples` * `n_samples`)`, sampled without replacement
          from all the samples.

        If ``inference=True``, then `max_samples` must either be an integer smaller than `n_samples//2` or a float
        less than or equal to .5.

    min_balancedness_tol: float in [0, .5], default=.45
        How imbalanced a split we can tolerate. This enforces that each split leaves at least
        (.5 - min_balancedness_tol) fraction of samples on each side of the split; or fraction
        of the total weight of samples, when sample_weight is not None. Default value, ensures
        that at least 5% of the parent node weight falls in each side of the split. Set it to 0.0 for no
        balancedness and to .5 for perfectly balanced splits. For the formal inference theory
        to be valid, this has to be any positive constant bounded away from zero.

    honest : bool, default=True
        Whether each tree should be trained in an honest manner, i.e. the training set is split into two equal
        sized subsets, the train and the val set. All samples in train are used to create the split structure
        and all samples in val are used to calculate the value of each node in the tree.

    inference : bool, default=True
        Whether inference (i.e. confidence interval construction and uncertainty quantification of the estimates)
        should be enabled. If ``inference=True``, then the estimator uses a bootstrap-of-little-bags approach
        to calculate the covariance of the parameter vector, with am objective Bayesian debiasing correction
        to ensure that variance quantities are positive.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether we should fit an intercept nuisance parameter beta(x).

    subforest_size : int, default=4,
        The number of trees in each sub-forest that is used in the bootstrap-of-little-bags calculation.
        The parameter `n_estimators` must be divisible by `subforest_size`. Should typically be a small constant.

    n_jobs : int or None, default=-1
        The number of parallel jobs to be used for parallelism; follows joblib semantics.
        `n_jobs=-1` means all available cpu cores. `n_jobs=None` means no parallelism.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
        randomly permuted at each split. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will
        select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best
        split among them. But the best found split may vary across different
        runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the
        improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one
        split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour
        during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The feature importances based on the amount of parameter heterogeneity they create.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized) total heterogeneity that the feature
        creates. Each split that the feature was chosen adds::

            parent_weight * (left_weight * right_weight)
                * mean((value_left[k] - value_right[k])**2) / parent_weight**2

        to the importance of the feature. Each such quantity is also weighted by the depth of the split.
        By default splits below `max_depth=4` are not used in this calculation and also each split
        at depth `depth`, is re-weighted by 1 / (1 + `depth`)**2.0. See the method ``feature_importances``
        for a method that allows one to change these defaults.
